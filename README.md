# RandomCppAdventures

## Overview
This is just a repository where I am going to put random C++ code that I write. I just wanted a place to put it all, and share my adventures with others. I will never claim to be a professional programmer, so I am sure there will be many things that I am doing wrong. If you see something that I am doing wrong, please let me know. I am always looking to learn more. 

In any case, I hope you enjoy my random C++ adventures!

For this repo I am using Visual Studio Code to write and compile my Cpp files.

## How to Compile and Run Cpp files in Visual Studio Code
Reference the [following](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).
