# OpenCV Face Detection

Am I really up to this task... esspeically because I am doing these things in Windows and not in an Ubuntu environment?

In anycase, [this](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/vs-code-with-opencv-c-on-windows-10-explained-256418442c52) may prove useful if I am planning to do so inside VS Code and on Windows.

On top of [this](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.html) of course.
